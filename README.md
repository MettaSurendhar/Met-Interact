# Met-Interact : Talk to a Database

## LIVE LINK : <a href="https://met-interact.streamlit.app" > CLICK ME 😊 </a>

- This is an end to end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. We are building a system that can talk to MySQL database.
- User asks questions in a natural language and the system generates answers by converting those questions to an SQL query and then executing that query on MySQL database.
  Met-Interact is a T-shirt store where they maintain their inventory, sales and discounts data in MySQL database.

  A store manager will ask questions such as,

  - How many white color Adidas t shirts do we have left in the stock?
  - How much sales our store will generate if we can sell all extra-small size t shirts after applying discounts?

  The system is intelligent enough to generate accurate queries for given question and execute them on MySQL database

## Project Highlights

- Met-Interact is a t shirt store that sells Adidas, Nike, Van Heusen and Levi's t shirts
- Their inventory, sales and discounts data is stored in a MySQL database
- We will build an LLM based question and answer system that will use following,
  - Google Palm LLM
  - Streamlit for UI
  - Langchain framework
  - Few shot learning
- In the UI, store manager will ask questions in a natural language and it will produce the answers

## Installation

1.Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MettaSurendhar/Met-Interact.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash

```

3.Acquire an api key through makersuite.google.com and put it in .env file

```bash
  GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

4. For database setup, run database/db_create_metta_tshirts.sql in your MySQL workbench
